# Deity Randomizer  

A small React app that randomly selects names of Goddesses and Gods from different pantheons.  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
This project was developed as an **exercise to practice React**, focusing on:  
- **Using components** to separate logic and presentation.  
- **Managing state** to dynamically update the UI.  
- **Fetching data from an external source**, simulating an API with JSON files containing the deities.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used  
- **React + Vite**
- **Bootstrap** for styling  
- **React State and Props**
